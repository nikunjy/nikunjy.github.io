        <p>
          I am Nikunj Yadav. Apart from looking out into the ocean wearing a
          tux. I manage a group of teams centered around core programming
          languages and developer productivity. Before Brex I have worked at
          Mixpanel, Uber, Facebook and Amazon. <br />
          <br />
          In 2024, we are living in the future already. We are talking to
          computers, computers are drawing art, directing videos, writing books,
          composing music. This is my calling and I am here to help build this
          future.
          <br /><br />
          My whole career has been in systems and infrastructure. I have built a
          lot of primitives and platforms over the past decade at different
          companies. But more recently I have loved writing some frontend,
          mobile and web apps. I am a Golang enthusiast and known to give hot
          takes on different programming languages.
