        <p>I am Nikunj Yadav. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Apart from looking out into the ocean wearing a tux, I work as a Tech lead Manager at Brex. Before Brex I have worked at Mixpanel, Uber, Facebook and Amazon. 
        I am passionate about systems, and performant software, however code that I write is not just in these fields cause a day without code is a sad day for me. 
        <br/>
        <br/>

         I live in San Francisco, have lived here since 2016 and still love it. 

         <br/>
         <br/>

         I was raised in Jaipur India and I did my undergrad from Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, followed by a masters at University of Texas at Austin.
